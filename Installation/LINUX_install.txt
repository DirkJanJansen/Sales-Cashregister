Barcode enabling in linux:

The solution for enabling the barcodereader is changed for it's not working anymore for Ubuntu 20.04
I changed as following.
Copy file .usbkbd.sh from folder installation in folder /home/postgres ($HOME)
chmod 755 .usbkbd.sh
If the password changed for Ubuntu from postgres45 change it too in .usbkbd.sh
Thats all. The script is called with starting Sales.py and the barcodescanner works again.
